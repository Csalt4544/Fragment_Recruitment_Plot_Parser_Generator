# Fragment_Recruitment_Plot_Parser_Generator
This Python program suite can be utilized to parse through fragment recruitment alignment files generated from either FR-HIT standard output .sop files or any alignment program that may generate a correctly formatted .sam file. Information from parsing is used to create a fragment recruitment plot based on position within the sample genome and percent identity to the reference genome.
